3 stimulus auditory oddball data in control, sub-acute mild TBI, and chronic TBI.   Rest data is also included.   3AOB data published here: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107125.  FYI, same task as this different dataset: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003490/versions/1.1.0.   For CTL and sub-acute mTBI: Session 1 was from 3 to 14 days post-injury and was the only session with MRI. (MRI will be uploaded ...later).  Session 2 was ~2 months (1.5 to 3) and Session 3 was ~4 months (3 to 5) following Session 1.   For Chronic TBI, there was only one session for this study.   There was A LOT of subject attrition over timepoints.   Same samples as reported here: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-66677-001   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31344589/   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31368085/  Task included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected 2016-2018 in the Center for Brain Recovery and Repair at the UNM Health Sciences Center.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for *LOTS* more meta data.   Analysis scripts are included to re-create the paper.  - James F Cavanagh 02/17/2021
